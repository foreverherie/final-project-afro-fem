									<h2>My hair is actually growing
										<br>
									Where are my bloody edges? Oh the hairstylist took them
									<hr>
									I will not relax my hair.
									If only I moisturized regulary
									I cant rock straight hair everyday
									<br>
									All natural hair is beautiful
									Kink is my curl
									Oh , this is working.
									Let me just buy it
									<br>
									I told you not to touch my hair, here wipe your oily fingers
									Natural hair but make it doable
									Oh my hair doesn‚Äôt do that
									Is my hair too damp
									<br>
									Bloody washday
									A head full of twists, hands devoid of strength 
									You don‚Äôt know what you are talking about.
									Nimejua sijui

								<h2>Natural hair is not healthy and its not information technology. 
								Luck has not been on my side with that. What I have been enjoying however is my freedom.
	  Sounds like an absolute fraud
Ah yes impostor syndrome babyyy.. I have been feeling like an impostor most of my life .
Naked house or whatever whoever said in that sex education episode .
I am also making peace with what I have .
I got myself a few things and I am going to call them gifts . </h2>
